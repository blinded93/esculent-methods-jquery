# Esculent Methods

Thanks for your interest in my recipe sharing application! This is a re-make of one of my previous projects that used the Ruby web framework Sinatra. The updated version is a single page app which uses Rails as a back-end with a Javascript/jQuery front-end.

The original app was inspired by my fairly recent foray into cooking. Keeping track of recipes seemed like a good project with the addition of a complexity of sharing with friends.

## Installation
Esculent Methods is a single page application using Ruby (2.5.1) on Rails (5.2.1.1) as a back-end and Javascript/jQuery (es6/4.3.3 jquery-rails gem) as a front-end.

Use the following commands to try out this application:
```
  $ git clone https://github.com/blinded93/esculent_methods
  $ cd esculent_methods
  $ bundle install
  $ rake db:migrate
  $ rails s
```
Navigate to the given address. (default: localhost:3000)
